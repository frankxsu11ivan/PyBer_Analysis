# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project the re-do is combined work from ASKBCS Learning and through Office hours. Deliverable 2 question #5 was broken loose by changes in structure of the date data.
#the overview of the project is to understand data to get to plotting. Plotting was taught through pandas and through matplotlib.
the story follows Python Ubers == pyber through and analysis of indices, columns and values. In these data frames the date is organized in dates as 'indexes',
columns as 'types' and values as 'fares'.
piviot tables further organize data

	Data frames are reorganized to clean up data.
 	method 1: pyplot
	from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
	plt.plot(...)
	plt.scatter(...)

	method 2: pandas = "object-oriented method"
	import pandas
	df.plot()
	plt.xlabels(...)

through the coursework the plots were straight froward. 
the challenge the plots were difficult for the data is grouped and resampled. it took an extra effort from the TA and AskBCs to get this turned around.

## Purpose
#the purpose of the plot is to tell a story. different line graphs to show different data.

## Analysis and Challenges
the group by analysis grouped data frames and delineated index from columns and values.

## Results
The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city Urban, Suburban and Rural types. 
with the how "left" some  urban data was not called. In the 'Urban' df the data table was used for the results.
with the two data.csv merged the analysis output Ride-sharing data include:
#total rides by type == 125 rural , 625 Suburban, 1625 Urban 
#total drivers == 78 rural, 490 Suburban, 2405 Urban
#total fares == 4327 rural, 19356 Suburban, 39854 Urban
#average fare per ride == 34.6 rural, 30.97 suburban, 24.52 Urban
#average fare per city = 34 Rural, 30 suburban, 24 Urban
#average fare per driver = 55 rural, 39 suburban, 16 Urban


##Summary
For the three business the recommendation to the CEO for the disparities among the city types is to focus on urban drivers.
there may be a profit center for suburban rides per type, however the rural share of riders should not be a profit center focus.
